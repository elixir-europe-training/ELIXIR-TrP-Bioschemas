It begins with the basics of website annotation, offering  foundational knowledge essential for understanding the process. The course then delves into the specifics of Bioschemas annotation, demonstrating how to apply it to an HTML page to enhance discoverability and interoperability. Following this, the guide explores the integration of Bioschemas with popular static site generators and content management systems, including Jekyll, Mkdocs, and Wordpress. Each section provides practical examples and step-by-step instructions to ensure learners can effectively implement Bioschemas annotations in their own projects. This training is designed to equip participants with the skills needed to improve the visibility and accessibility of their training content on the web.</p> <p></p> <p> Prerequisites To be able to follow this course, learners should have knowledge in: \u20031. Basic knowledge of GitHub - git <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>clone</code>, and branches \u20032. Basic knowledge of HTML - fundamental HTML examples using <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>footer</code> etc. </p> <p></p> <p> Learning Outcomes: By the end of the course, learners will be able to: \u20031. Understand and explain the fundamental concepts of website annotation and the importance of Bioschemas in enhancing web content discoverability and interoperability. \u20032. Apply Bioschemas annotations to HTML pages, Jekyll, Mkdocs, and Wordpress sites, following step-by-step instructions to improve the visibility and accessibility of training content. \u20033. Evaluate and troubleshoot the implementation of Bioschemas annotations across different platforms, ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the annotations in real-world scenarios.</p> <p></p> <p> Target Audience: Training Content Developer, Trainers </p> <p> Level: Intermediate </p> <p> License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License </p> <p> Funding: This project has received funding from the ELIXIR Training Programme 2024-2026.  </p>"},{"location":"#authors","title":"Authors","text":"<p>Alexander Botzki</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: VIB, ELIXIR-BE </p> <p>Bruna Piereck</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: VIB, ELIXIR-BE </p> <p>Greek Mythology icons made by max.icons from www.flaticon.com</p>"},{"location":"#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":"<p>Phil Reed</p> <p> :simple-linkedin: Research Community and Training Manager, Information Management, The University of Manchester. </p>"},{"location":"#citing-this-lesson","title":"Citing this lesson","text":"<p>Please cite as:</p> <ol> <li>Alexander Botzki, Bruna Piereck Moura.

Usually, HTML tags tell the browser how to display the information included in the tag. For example, <code>&lt;h1&gt;Avatar&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tells the browser to display the text string \u201cAvatar\u201d in a heading 1 (h1) format. However, the HTML tag doesn\u2019t give any information about what that text string \u201cAvatar\u201d means. It could refer to the hugely successful 3D movie, or it could refer to a type of profile picture. Missing a clear definition can make it more difficult for search engines to intelligently display relevant content to a user.</p> <p>With the goal to help search engines understand the web content better, webmasters use Schema.org to add structured data to their websites. Schema.org helps webmasters to provide a collection of shared vocabularies which they can use to mark up their pages in ways that can be understood by the major search engines: Google, Microsoft and alike. This can lead to improved search rankings and more attractive search results. The term vocabulary in this broad context refers to a set of types and properties used to describe different content, such as products, reviews, or events. Each content type has an extensive set of associated properties. At the end of 2024, Schema.org lists more than 800 types with close to 1500 properties. Altogether they form the allowed vocabulary, webmasters can use to mark up their websites. How can this markup be included on websites? Webmasters can choose three different formats to add information to their Web content: JSON-LD, Microdata, or RDFa formats. </p> <p>As training providers, we can also use these structured data to increase findability of our training-related content in web browsers. The Bioschemas community aims to improve the findability on the web of life sciences resources such as datasets, software, and training materials. It does this by encouraging people in the life sciences to use Schema.org markup in their websites so that they are indexable by search engines and other services. They define usage profiles over the Schema.org types that identify the essential properties to use in describing a resource. This guide will help get you up to speed with Bioschemas and the JSON-LD format so that you can start adding markup to your web pages. Although this guide focuses on Bioschemas and JSON-LD objects, the basic ideas (types, properties etc.) introduced here are relevant beyond JSON-LD and apply for other markup with microdata or RDFa.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_00/#bioschemas-profiles-for-training-resources","title":"Bioschemas profiles for training resources","text":"<p>Many training related resources will include pages describing tutorials or courses.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an \u201cinformation\u201d to the browser about what document type to expect.</p> <p>This is an example of an HTML file with three HTML elements - <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. For the outer <code>html</code> element (<code>html</code> is the tagname), the start tag is <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and the end tag is <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. The <code>/</code> in front of the tagname indicates an end tag. </p> <p>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is the root element of an HTML page. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element contains meta information about the HTML page and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element defines the document\u2019s body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p> <p>Now, let\u2019s focus on the markup of the HTML page. There are several technical options to markup an HTML file, we focus on using a JSON-LD object in combination with a Bioschemas annotation.</p> <p>As you see in the code example above, the markup of the HTML page with the Bioschemas annotation as a JSON-LD object needs to be added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and be included in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element with the attribute <code>type=\"application/ld+json\"</code>.</p> <p>Since we are annotating a course, we use the Bioschemas profiles <code>Course/CourseInstance</code>.
